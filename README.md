# CALL-FLOODING-
SPAM ANDROID AS WELL AS IPHONE USERS WITH CALL FLOODING........

The script requires working network connection to work.
    No balance will be deducted for using this script to send SMS/calls.
    While doing infinite bombing use 2-3 seconds delay and 10 to 20 threads for maximum performance.
    Don't put spaces in between phone number (Ex- 99999 99999)
    Make sure you are using the latest version of TBomb
    Make sure you are using Python3.

Here's how you can check it. Type this command in your terminal.

$ python -V

If output looks like Python 3 - Congrats, Python 3 is installed properly.

 Do not use this to harm others.
